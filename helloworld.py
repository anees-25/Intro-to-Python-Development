#It demonstrates basic arithmetic operations in Python. It starts by printing a message 'adding numbers', then adds two numbers (17 and 25) and stores the result in the variable 'x'. Next, it prints 'dividing numbers' and attempts to divide the value of 'x' by zero, which will result in a ZeroDivisionError. Finally, it prints 'yey i did math', but this line will not be executed due to the error in the previous line.
#This code snippet is used to illustrate the concept of error handling in Python, specifically by catching and handling the ZeroDivisionError exception.
# print('adding numbers')
# x= 17 + 25
# print('dividing numbers')
# y= x/0
# print('yey i did math')

# Using double quotes for this string because the string itself contains a single quote
# print("It's a small world after all")
